# What is config used for

This module is used to collect user inputs. It is not fully functional but can already be used to provide specific input information to create a new INSPIRE metadata document.

The config YAML files provide a structured way to document all ETL processes or resources that will be included in the next "run" of conceptMeta Program.
For Each ETL process included you can add information that relates specifically to one process. There you can specific things like the name of a dataset and the path to existing metadata and more.
